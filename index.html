<p>She's just a girl, and she's on fire</P>
<p>Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway</P>
<p>She's living in a world, and it's on fire</P>
<p>Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away</P>
<p>Oh, she got both feet on the ground</P>
<p>And she's burning it down</P>
<p>Oh, she got her head in the clouds</P>
<p>And she's not backing down</P>
<p>This girl is on fire</P>
<p>This girl is on fire</P>
<p>She's walking on fire</P>
<p>This girl is on fire</P>
<p>Looks like a girl, but she's a flame</P>
<p>So bright, she can burn your eyes</P>
<p>Better look the other way</P>
<p>You can try but you'll never forget her name</P>
<p>She's on top of the world</P>
<p>Hottest of the hottest girls say</P>
<p>Oh, we got our feet on the ground</P>
<p>And we're burning it down</P>
<p>Oh, got our head in the clouds</P>
<p>And we're not coming down</P>
